        <h3>New Trade Theory(NTT) In Context of Nigeria </h3>
        <p><b>Introduction to new Trade Theory(NTT)</b></p>
        <p>The <b>New Trade Theory(NTT)</b>, developed in the 1970s and 1980s,marked a revutionary shift from earlier trade theories like absolute and comparative advantage. This theory, pioneered by economists such as <b>paul krugman,</b> highlights the importance of economies of scale, network effect, and product differentation in international trade. unlike traditional theories that focused on natural resource advantage, NTT emphasizes how countries can establish domainance in industries through first-mover advantages and increasing returns to scale, even without inherent comparatives advantage.</p>
        
        <p>For a country like Nigeria, NTT offers an insightful perspective on its internaational trade dynamics, economics challenges, and potential for growth. Nigeria is endowed with vast natural resouress, a growing population, and a stratagic geographical position, but it also faces significant challenges that must be addressed to fully realize the benefits of NTT.</p>
